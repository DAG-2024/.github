## 1. What is the problem you are trying to solve?

- The challenge of understanding human speech from distorted or incomprehensible digital audio recordings.

## 2. Describe briefly, in high level your presumed solution

- We propose to develop a tool that leverages generative AI to analyze and enhance digital audio, correcting distortions and improving the clarity of human speech.

## 3. Are there other approaches?

- Existing approaches include traditional audio filtering techniques, noise reduction algorithms, and specialized hardware solutions. However, these methods often fail to fully reconstruct intelligible speech from highly degraded audio.

## 4. Who are the expected users of the application?

- The application is designed for a diverse user base, including:
  - Individuals and professionals seeking to recover speech from poor-quality recordings (e.g., journalists, researchers, podcasters).
  - Developers looking to integrate audio enhancement capabilities into their applications.

## 5. What will be the main features and flows of the (different) user(s)?

- Our initial goal is to create a working model focused on demonstrating the core functionality of enhancing distorted audio. Therefore, our emphasis will be less on user interface and usability features and more on achieving a high-quality, functional prototype. Future iterations may include user interface and more user-friendly functionality according to our progress 

## **6\. Are there any external dependencies?**

- As part of the Generative AI Application Workshop, we will research and utilize existing AI models and tools, such as pre-trained generative AI frameworks. We will adapt and fine-tune these models to meet the specific requirements of our project.
